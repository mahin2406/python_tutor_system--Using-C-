Corey:
1. Learn to create a dictionary and access its elements.
(Step 1.) Ceate a dictionary named student with the following key-value pairs: {"name": "John", "age": 25, "course": "Python"} 
(Step 2.) Print the value associated with the key "name".
(Step 3.) Update the "course" key to "Advanced Python" and print the updated dictionary.
2. Practice iterating over keys, values, and key-value pairs in a dictionary.
(Step 1.)Using the student dictionary from Exercise 1, iterate over its keys and print them.
(Step 2.) Iterate over its values and print them.
(Step 3.)Iterate over the key-value pairs and print them in the format "key: value".
3. Learn to work with nested dictionaries.
(Step 1.)Create a nested dictionary classroom with two student sub-dictionaries:
(Step 2.) Access and print the name of student2.
(Step 3.) Add a new key-value pair "grade": "A" to student1 and print the updated classroom dictionary.

7. Install and Import NumPy.
(Step 1.) To install NumPy: pip install numpy
(Step 2.) To import NumPy: import numpy as np
8. Create a 1D array named Gary that includes the numbers: 1, 8, 7, 6, 4.
(Step 1.) Import numpy in your code: import numpy as np
(Step 2.) Create the array: Gary = np.array([1, 8, 7, 6, 4])
9. Print a random integer using the Random Library.
(Step 1.) include the random library: import random
(Step 2.) Create a random integer: random_int = random.randint(1, 100)
(Step 3.) Print a random number: print("Random Integer:", random_int)
