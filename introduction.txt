Introduction to Dictionaries!

 Grasping the concept of dictionaries enables you to more precisely represent various real-world entities. 
By creating a dictionary for a person, you have the flexibility to include extensive details about them, such as their name, age, location, profession, and other describable attributes. 
 Essentially, dictionaries allow you to pair any two related types of information, like correlating words with their definitions, associating individuals with their preferred numbers, or linking mountains to their heights, among other possibilities. 
In Python, a dictionary consists of key-value pairs where each key is linked to a specific value. 
 By using a key, you can retrieve the value linked to it. The value assigned to a key can vary widelyâ€”it could be a number, a string, a list, or another dictionary. Essentially, any Python object that you can create can serve as a value within a dictionary.
