NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, along with tools for working with these arrays. NumPy arrays are more efficient than Python's built-in list data structure, especially for large datasets, due to their fixed data type and contiguous memory allocation. The library supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including linear algebra, statistical operations, and Fourier transforms. With a clear and concise syntax, NumPy makes numerical computations in Python both accessible and efficient, making it an essential tool for data analysis, scientific research, and engineering applications.
